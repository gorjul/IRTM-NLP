# IRTM-NLP

We analyse tweets containing the keyword "trump" to see if the sentiment changes over time. We will be using Jefferson Henrique's GetOldTweets-python script (it can be found here https://github.com/Jefferson-Henrique/GetOldTweets-python) to retrieve tweets older than 1 week (if you use the twitter API you can only get tweets as old as one week back in time). See file extract.py for that.

Then we will perform text analysis and information retrieval techniques to get important information like the sentiment of the tweets to make assumptions of the standing point of people towards POTUS Donald Trump.

There is alsoa version what uses the twitter API to look for tweets of a specific account and perform some analysis on that. See twitter_api.py for that.
